smart gallery
=============

Gallery showing two pictures next to eachother,
with the user given the choice of which they would prefer to see again.

Pictures with a ranking too low are excluded from being displayed,
that depends on the average score of pictures.

The gallery can be controlled via either mouse or keyboard.
